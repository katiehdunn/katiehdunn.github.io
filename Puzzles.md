## Puzzle-writing
In addition to puzzle-hunting as a hobby with [teammate](https://www.puzzles.wiki/wiki/Teammate), I have started authoring puzzles.

Here are a few I've written, for various hunts:

### For Mystery Hunt 2023:
* [Street Smarts](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/puzzles/street-smarts), a local Boston puzzle
* [Redacted Recipes](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/basement/redacted-recipes), a cryptic
* [Second-rate Tile](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/basement/second-rate-tiles)
* [Subterranean Secrets](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/basement/subterranean-secrets), consisting of riddles
* [Think Fast](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/puzzlefactory.place/basement/think-fast)

## Art
I've also created icons and art for some of these hunts using Procreate and Inkscape.
* I designed the [round map](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum), [atrium](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/rounds/atrium) and [art gallery](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/rounds/art) in Mystery Hunt '23.
* I also made the following icons:
