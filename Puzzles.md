While creating various hunts, I've also been involved on the art team. I used Procreate and Inkscape to make some icons and backgrounds.
* I designed the [round map](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum), [atrium](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/rounds/atrium) and [art gallery](https://puzzles.mit.edu/2023/interestingthings.museum/rounds/art) in Mystery Hunt '23.
* I also made the following icons:
