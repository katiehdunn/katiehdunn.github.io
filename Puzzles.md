<p>In addition to puzzle-hunting as a hobby with teammate, I have started authoring puzzles</p>

<p>Here are a few I've written, for various hunts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For Mystery Hunt 2023</li>

	<li>For <a href=https://2020.teammatehunt.com/>teammate hunt 2020</a></li>


	<li>For Teammate Hunt 2021</li>

	  <li><a href=https://2020.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/office-candidate>Office Candidate</a>, a word puzzle</li>

	<li>Fire-Quackers, for <a href=https://2020.teammatehunt.com/puzzles/fire-quackers>teammate hunt 2020</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I've also created icons and art for some of these hunts using Procreate and Inkscape.</p>

I hope to write more soon!
