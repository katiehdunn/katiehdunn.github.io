    Prelude: I like doing many things.

    That said, this might end up being about teaching philosophy tbh - pull from cover letter?

	I love teaching science, but not just so that students learn what mitochondria are. In today's information age, learning is no longer about memorization of facts, but rather the ability to link those facts to new ideas and apply them to different ways of thinking. By practicing scientific "meta-skills", such as supporting claims with evidence, learners acquire a foundation that engenders both intellectual growth and interdisciplinary understanding through the rest of their lives. But the importance of science education is twofold: not only for learners to develop this ability to think scientifically, but also to gain exposure to and passion for the natural world and all its phenomena. Too often, big ideas are obfuscated by advanced mathematical notation or technical jargon; I believe the two can be decoupled, and everyone can appreciate the basic principles that govern the natural world. With a solid foundation of these big ideas, learners will be well-prepared to tackle  technical details and examine material in depth later in their educational careers.

	As a profession, teaching means a lot more than simply transmitting correct information to learners. It's a dynamic profession where learners' needs and the best ways to meet them are constantly in flux. Many pedagogical methods are currently being developed to improve our current education system, and it's time to research what actually works and re-imagine the space of educational possibilities. Yet even with all these exciting new ideas, there will be no panacea; that is, I know no one method will work for every learner. As I've learned more about learning, I've developed great empathy for every individual; it's clear to me that each learner has their own strengths. I believe in creating equitable learning environments for everyone, with low floors (scaffolding an accessible entry point for all learners), high ceilings (high expectations and not stopping at 'good enough'), and wide walls (many ways to reach success). As a teacher, I have to constantly question my assumptions and re-examine my practice to best serve the needs of a diverse population, and I look forward to making these goals a reality.
	
	My educational philosophy in brief: 
	<ol>
	    
	<li> In today's information age, learning is no longer about memorization of facts, but rather the ability to link those facts to new ideas and apply problem-solving skills. Through increased awareness and practice of "meta-skills", learners acquire a foundation that engenders  intellectual growth through the rest of their lives. 
	    
	<li> Too often, basic principles are obfuscated by advanced notation or technical jargon; I believe the two can and should be decoupled. Everyone can learn and appreciate big-picture models &amp; apply their understanding to better decision-making.
	    
	<li> Teaching is much more than simply transmitting correct information to learners. It's a dynamic profession where learners' needs and the best ways to meet them are constantly in flux. Many pedagogical methods are currently being developed to improve our current education system, and it's time to research what actually works and re-imagine the space of educational possibilities. As an educator, I must constantly question my assumptions and re-examine my practice.
	    
	<li> Learners are diverse in their needs and goals. I believe in creating equitable learning environments with low floors (scaffolding accessible entry points), high ceilings (high expectations and not stopping at "good enough"), and wide walls (many paths to success).
