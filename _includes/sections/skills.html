As research lead at the Center for Curriculum Redesign, I have worked to through the theoretical framework of how education should adapt to an increasingly volatile world. I co-authored the book Education for the Age of AI, and I feel confident in my ability to both synthesize literature reviews and manage timelines in a research capacity. Education often suffers from a gap between research and practice, made only wider by the fact that the tools students have available and what is worth learning are constantly changing; in this sense, it feels similar to AI policy. Just as “education engineering” involves solid theoretical grounds but also the ability to take a leap of faith for what will be reasonable when transferring to a new context, I expect there to be many unknowns that will require best guesses, paired with documentation of clear reasoning transparency. In my other roles at nonprofits and as a public school teacher, I have advocated for change at the policy level to improve educational systems; however, this is difficult in a field where inertia is quite high, and navigating that reality with many different stakeholders is necessary in any policy work.
