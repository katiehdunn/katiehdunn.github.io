<h4>Education</h4>
<p> Education is a field fraught with assumptions. If you like, you can more about my thoughts on educational philosophy here (TODO). That said, I have worked on:</p>

<ul>
	<li> curriculum and lesson design: some examples (TODO) </li>
	<li> teaching, virtual and in-person </li>
	<li> professional development for teachers and principals</li>
</ul>

<h4>Organization & Logistics</h4>
<p> In addition to the skills involved in classroom management, I am comfortable sorting out the details involved in large events, like finding venues and creating workflows for reimbursement. Some specific roles I've worked in include:</p>
<ul> 
	<li> site director for a 6.5-week residential program </li>
	<li> manager of a team of four, defining goals, budget & timelines </li>
	<li> logistics lead at MIT Mystery Hunt, preparing an on-site weekend event for over 1,000 participants </li>
</ul>
