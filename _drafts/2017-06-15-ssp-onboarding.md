Rasmi, Rebecca, Jeff. I guess these are my coworkers for the next five-and-some weeks. Well then… here we go.

It seems silly of me to point at all the parts of SSP that are different. Things change, and that’s alright. What, swing dancing isn’t taught anymore? Oh, we hold lecture in that building now? And…wait a minute… curfew?!?!

I know that the goal here isn’t to recreate my own memories. But I do want to allow all these students to have a wondrous time, to create memories they’ll be fond of many years down the road, and not to get the wrong idea about this camp. Or… am I the one who has the wrong idea these days?

Maybe I’m just forgetful, but I remember SSP emphasizing to me how it had a “secret sauce” of sorts, a special something that bound the students together in a way no other camp could. I remember the program highlighting how magical it could be, to be with these sorts of peers in such a unique setting.

What I don’t remember was a 3AM – excuse me, let’s push that to 2 AM – curfew, or an email telling students to work hard because they might get sent home for the their “attitude” – specifically, with regards to being “more interested in goofing off and hanging out with their new best friends than in working hard and doing good science”. ???????

Excuse me? You put up a curfew so that people can stay awake in class? I think I can actually speak for my fellow SSPers (or they can speak for themselves) when I say that SSP goes far beyond academics, that that’s the smallest, most insignificant part of the experience. Lecture notes became origami even before the program’s end, but I have a friend of four years I see every week thanks to SSP. Some have claimed 80% of their memories at camp were from after dark; others said that a curfew “takes away two-thirds of the point”. And trust me, lectures and psets were not part of the point.

I understand: we have to have some rules in place. Participants have to learn to be accountable, show up on time, and learn to put in effort in academics without the external motivation of tests or grades. But I thought learning to navigate the balance between sleep, study and fun was fantastic without some firm hand forcibly guiding me in one direction or another. I can’t believe that punishment for being out past curfew is dismissal from the program! In ’13, we coined the term “sunrising”, for staying up that late (early) – that’s how integral it was to our culture. One of my fondest memories is sunrising from the top of a climbable pine tree, pulling an all-nighter for the first time in my life, and counting the hours in arc-minutes with my fingers as the sun rose steadily higher in the sky. (And getting very stuck and scraped on the way down). Another was falling asleep in a piano room with a friend; another, laying atop a staircase to nowhere, watching the stars cycle by. I just can’t take that away from anyone!

I…I’ll try to be a good TA, in line with the rules about other things; I’ll try to internalize that kids need some strict rules to begin with so things don’t spiral out of control. I’ll even try to understand that the faculty’s advice comes from good intentions, and manage to force a smile when the faculty talks about the kids with an “us-versus-them” mentality. I know I’m supposed to be on the faculty’s side, even if I can’t help identifying more with the students. But to take away the possibility for even forming those memories is just wrong! I can’t do it.

(I would probably be fired if these kinds of sentiments were discovered by my fellow faculty, or the incoming class. Because, apparently, I am first and foremost an employee of SSP. I’ve signed contracts to follow and enforce rules, even the ones I disagree with. “Be friendly to the students, but not their friend,” they say.)

Sigh…at the end of the day, ignore my ranting, for now…it’s just a bad feeling I’ve got. Maybe it’ll all turn out to be okay after all. Maybe this silliness goes on behind the scenes every year, and the students manage to make the magic happen anyway. Here’s to hoping. (…And maybe a little bit of enabling.)
