13:13, upper bed, 5W, Cambridge

I haven’t written in a while, but I do also want to press “publish” for something in the next 30 minutes. So here are some (perhaps more so than usual) disjointed pieces.

When I think back to times when I was forced to be extremely productive, the experience wasn’t all that painful – and of course, I look back on those times with some amount of happiness or pride. It feels pretty good to get a lot done. So why is it that my brain has entirely failed to respond to this classical conditioning?

The main difference between those rare moments and the majority of days is that some external deadline/motivator brings my focus back to the task at hand when I normally would have stopped. So where is my time going today, and why isn’t it productive?

Today I browsed the Facebook pages of some people I had not seen since middle or high school. They’re doing things – I know, FB and the whole FOMO issue – but I mean, some have released albums or starred in concerts; others are spending a year abroad; others – well, they’re admittedly just at tons of parties in their sorority. But still – with few exceptions, all of them seem to have…grown up? There’s just a few of us who seem to have stood still in time, stuck in some sort of gameified simulation instead of stepping into real life. The guy from band whose college life was still only about band. And perhaps me, still the introverted academic, who instead of playing science bowl does puzzles every now and again.*

So how do I get anywhere? I understand that the path to success isn’t a straight line, à la this image from the internet:

But dealing with that tangled mess along the way is really hard, and then the goal fades from your vision, etc.

This morning, I made a table of activities that I sometimes do, their utility, duration, and effort spent. The results were pretty concerning. I felt like many tasks I did without putting much effort in or getting much out of them fairly often, while the tasks I knew I would appreciate having done later (e.g. exercise) rarely got done.

Knowing this, though, will I change my behavior? I’m inclined to guess “no”. But why? S1 answer: effort. What’s wrong with that? S1 answer: lazy.

…

Here’s a story someone told in education class (wording approximate):

I had thought that wrong notes came from being “bad at piano” or “not practicing hard enough,” and if you practiced harder the clinkers would go away. But wrong notes always have a cause – an immediate physical cause. Just before you play a wrong note, your fingers were in a position that made that wrong note inevitable. Fixing wrong notes isn’t about “practicing harder” but about trying to unkink those systematically error-causing fingerings and hand motions.

 

In the same way, perhaps laziness can be reframed as “you’re not meeting your obligations and I don’t know why.” If it turns out that you’ve been missing appointments because you don’t keep a calendar, then you’re not intrinsically “lazy” so much as executing the wrong procedure.

Well that’s great. But where’s my procedure going wrong? What can I do to change it? I’m just too lazy to even think about it, which brings us back to the problem at hand. And to finish this off, here’s an excerpt from Art & Fear (David Bayles, Ted Orland):

The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.

 

Well, at grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

So this model boils down to something like

Don’t think too much
Do X many times/iterate
Learn from your mistakes
This model asserts that quantity trumps quality, that you cannot improve until you’ve mentally committed to doing X over and over again. What I don’t understand is how one can follow the third principle without violating the first. How do you just learn without getting stuck in that phase? When is it “enough learning” and time to move on?

*I admit this is not entirely correct. I do feel like I’ve taken a concrete step in moving into “real life” by getting my teaching license. Just like doing scibowl + biocamp + SSP felt like a “fast-track”/the “correct ingredients” for getting into college, I feel like licensure is putting me in a pre-etched groove bound for real life. If I had not signed up for the program, I would definitely feel a lot more lost. I wonder if this has something to do with the idea of, embark on activity X if you can see the concrete results at the end of X? I hate this mindset because I don’t think everything needs to be done for a purpose/to gain a concrete thing at the end, but I think there’s some merit to it. But I think there’s merit to the idea there, even if the conditional form it’s expressed in is totally wrong.*
