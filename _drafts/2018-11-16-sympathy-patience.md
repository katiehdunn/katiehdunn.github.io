That’s not how responsibility works…When you do a fault analysis, there’s no point in assigning fault to a part of the system you can’t change afterward, it’s like stepping off a cliff and blaming gravity. Gravity isn’t going to change next time. There’s no point in trying to allocate responsibility to people who aren’t going to alter their actions. Once you look at it from that perspective, you realize that allocating blame never helps anything unless you blame yourself, because you’re the only one whose actions you can change by putting blame there.

This quote might be wrong. That is, I make no claims that this is the best way for a rational agent to act. In fact, it’s probably wrong, if only because it’s such an extreme view. Still, it’s just… how I strive to act.

Back in negotiation class, we learned of some common fallacies: anchoring, time pressure, and other psych-based “dark arts”; belief in a zero-sum game; and other mindsets that lead to failed negotiation when people demonize the other side (e.g. partake in tribalism, self-righteousness, fight/flight, the whole “I have perseverance – you are stubborn – he is pig-headed” thing). And in this class, I nodded along: yup, seems true. I am aware of these traps and generally seek to avoid them. For instance, I try to actively notice things like correspondence bias (in education, we hear about this to nearly no end).

But after being lulled into complacency, the next slide surprised me. My professor claimed that in addition to these negative mindsets, there are positive traps as well, mindsets that promote negotiation and understanding when it doesn’t actually make sense to. He touched upon concepts -even “fallacies” – like universalism (presuming all people are essentially the same in a way that will actually matter/be realized), contextual rationalization (brushing off others’ negative behaviors by attributing them to context); consistently favoring rehabilitation over retribution; distributing fault equally between all sides (or ignoring it altogether); consistently looking for win-win or ways to “expand the pie”; and erring towards appeasement & compromise instead of fight/flight.

My professor (and the book we were drawing from that day, Mnookin’s Bargaining with the Devil) claimed both the negative (demonizing and positive mindsets suffer the same meta-problems: a selective worldview cherry-picking evidence. And indeed, I realized many of these mindsets are ones I strive to embody. So the rationalist in me welled up and was like “hmmmm… Am I being reasonable here?”

After a bit of thought, I noticed a lot of hypocrisy in myself. I work best when people push me hard, but coddle my own students a bit. I make things easy for other people, while holding myself to higher standards.

This plays out in many ways. For example, I might not mind if someone gets angry with me, but I’ll go out of my way to avoid anger to them in case it’s offensive. Or I excuse others’ lateness, but feel extremely bad when I’m the late one. More generally speaking, I push the fault and onus to change onto myself, while assuming others can’t really do it. (Perhaps some of this can be chalked up to “bad theory of mind”.)

And maybe it makes sense to abide by that kind of quote in a world where everyone else is doing it. Maybe it even makes sense in a world where nobody else is doing it. Maybe it just… makes sense. But can you ever foist the quote upon others? Can’t I just passively put it up on a wall in my classroom and see what happens?

But as a teacher, is that the responsible thing to do? Don’t I want my students to be a little more self-aware? Is it any better than, say…doing all the meta-work for my students, and making the class easy for them? Sure, I’m helping them learn how to fish well, but I’m not helping them learn how to learn to fish – and that’s the important stuff. I’ve also heard time and time again that students (to a reasonable degree) rise to the expectations set for them. And my standards, it seems, are pretty low. (This seems at least true by default; if a student demonstrates competency, I’m more than happy to treat them as a peer.)

I’ve started internalizing how impatient I am, too. Sure, my mom and sister said this years ago, but I didn’t actually believe it. At the time, I thought I worked with struggling students well. I’d let them work through the problem, and be ready to supply answers. In retrospect, I’m way too ready. I’m so eager to get to the insight, so ready to step in and fill in the knowledge gap and missing link and the misconception, so eager to show what I know that I don’t sit back and wait and let the student do this for themselves. With all my meta-scaffolding, it’s little wonder that students wouldn’t learn to succeed in their next class.

In such an environment, I’m not helping people become independent thinkers or autodidacts; I’m not giving them skills they’d need to create something cool or pursue their own projects. I’m just giving them tools to cheat the system that currently exists. And that’s not what I’m going for. I think. I hope.

Next steps to self//open threads:

What can I do to practice more patience? How much struggle is good for students? What is good struggle? What (meta-)work should I do/not do for students?
