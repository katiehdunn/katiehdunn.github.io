13:21, underbed, 5W, Cambridge (though actually written perhaps a fortnight ago)

Note: as a bit of a spoiler warning, the following mentions some activities from 21M.600. I don’t want to give anyone preconceived notions about the class, and I have a strong feeling that reading this is nothing like the experience of having been in the room yourself.

Scene: a large open room, clean wooden floors unblemished by shoemarks

Then…close your eyes. Imagine you are at the beach. Engage all the senses: hear the waves, smell the salt. Are you ready?

Open your eyes. I saw the sand, and actually believed it was hard to walk through. Really visualize the scene. Where’s the waterline? I run away from the larger-than-expected wave, let my gaze trail along the barely-shrubby growth at the fringe of the surf.

Then you’re in a hot parking lot. I shield my face from the sun as I force myself to trudge onward. But a cloud comes by, and then later, a breeze. And then it’s autumn, vivid red leaves against a grey sky. It begins to drizzle; I put my hood up, and pause every so often to use my fingers as windshield wipers for my glasses. And as what has become a downpour ceases, I come out from my makeshift shelter to navigate puddles, just as badly as I do in real life. It’s a spring day. It’s Thanksgiving. It’s wintertime – and you’re a child again.

I slide down the sidewalks in my socks-turned-shoes, and whirl about in wonder. Somehow I remember to look up, and see icicles. I begin a swordfight with myself, even daring to consider licking it. And then you’re kids at school, and I once more walk along the edges of the playground, stopping by the “chess club” of 1 and watching the rest of the children – my peers – play tag or foursquare.

Now go home. I did my homework after eating a snack, and flopped on the bed to read a book, trying out a few different positions. Reading, reading… and now you’re in your room still, but in the present, and alone.

Hm.

I notice the relaxedness ebb quickly as I put on a more serious face. I glance at my psets, but end up clicking about on the computer. I get up to vacuum once, and go back to the screen, looking but not seeing. And somewhere, on some meta level of thought, I wondered at how depressing it all was.

The above exercise was one of the most interesting I’ve had while at MIT. I reclaimed parts of childhood that were long forgotten, and experienced all at once the sudden contrast between then and now – apparently, I’ve grown up a bit. Who knew?

Acting has done this more than just once, too: one person’s solo piece was about a middle schooler’s day, and I couldn’t help but smile at the heartwarming poignancy of it all. What was so different about memory lane? How could the scene painted be so different from that of my current reality?

Eventually, I decided that the characters there could revel in the novelty of their stimuli. The world seemed so big, and to constantly be getting bigger. Every emotion was so strong; getting detention or performing at a recital or falling in love was a landmark, not just some habitual thing that happens along the cycle of life. When did I lose that? I had sworn to myself not to lose it! Is there no way to find it again?

Say you have an urn filled with a finite number of colored balls, and you’re pulling them out one at a time and recording the result. Does your predictive power increase over time? My guess ended up being a somewhat counterintuitive “no”. If your sample size is only n=1, the whole procedure is hopeless.

What are the implications for this in life? I don’t know if it’s “sufficiently large” or “well-mixed”; how can I update in the right ways to “do life better”? Can we learn from history? Or are we doomed to fall into cycles (consider the heights of the Greeks!), information always being created and nearly as often being destroyed?

Is it not sad that we get only one chance at this life?

I mean, it’s a bit odd that I’d think that. I’m not particularly attached to this one, after all. But maybe that’s just because I’ve already screwed up the opening game.
