<p>Hello! I'm Katie, a part-time education researcher.</p>

<p> I'm currently exploring a few more options beyond education, looking for work that both feels like I do good and that actually does good. While those sound like similar goals that are a bit naive, I think they end up being surprisingly different and important to me. </p>

<p> I began my higher education believing I would go into astrophysics, but transitioned from the physical sciences to secondary education in my  senior year of college. I've since taught, worked at a few nonprofits, and run summer programs. A generalist at heart, I have studied linguistics, earth sciences, astronomy, literature, biology, and behavioral sciences; that said, my enduring passions have been &amp; continue to be learning about learning and helping people become their best selves.</p>

<p>This site (perhaps obviously) is very much a work-in-progress, so please check back later! I have quite a number of todos...</p>

    Laughter and tears are both responses to frustration and exhaustion. I myself prefer to laugh, since there is less cleaning do to do afterward.
