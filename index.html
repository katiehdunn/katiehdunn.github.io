Hey! 

This site (perhaps obviously) is still a work-in-progress.
I have some todos:

It's still a work-in-progress, so check back later!

<ul>
	<li>Configure the index page/write about</li>
	<li>Port some posts over</li>
	<li>Retool or kill the archive page</li>
	<li>Consider making the "resume" into a CV</li>
	<li>Rework the "about" section in above</li>
	<li>Link external docs</li>
	<li>how to reorder the things in the menu??</li>
	<li>update personal info</li>
	<li>why can't I make the index page an md?</li>
</ul>
