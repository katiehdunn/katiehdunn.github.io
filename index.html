Hey! 

This site (perhaps obviously) is still a work-in-progress.
I have some todos:

It's still a work-in-progress, so check back later!

<ul>
	<li>Configure the index page (write 'about' below)</li>
	<li>Port my posts over</li>
	<li>Link external docs on cv?</li>
	<li>Change default alpha order of menu?</li>
	<li>why can't I make the index page an md?</li>
</ul>

A bit about me: 

I'm a generalist at heart, 
Linguistics, earth, atmospheric plaentary sciences. Reading and writing all the things.

These days, I'm a Massachusetts-certified biology and physics teacher. I graduated from MIT with a B.S. in Physics in 2018, and am currently enrolled in a M.Ed. program at Woodrow Wilson Graduate School in Cambridge. I have taught in Boston Public Schools for two years as a student teacher, completed the Scheller Teacher Education Program at MIT, and worked in informal learning spaces &amp; educational summer programs since 2014.
