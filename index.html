<p>Hello! I'm Katie, a part-time education researcher.</p>

<p> I'm currently exploring a few more options beyond education, looking for work that both feels like I do good and that actually does good â€“ despite sounding like a) similar goals and b) a bit naive, I think they end up being surprisingly different. </p>

<p> I began my higher education believing I would go into astrophysics, but transitioned from the physical sciences to secondary education in my undergraduate senior year. I've since taught, worked at a few nonprofits, and run summer programs. A generalist at heart, I have studied linguistics, earth sciences, astronomy, literature, biology, and behavioral sciences; that said, my enduring passion has been &amp; continues to be learning about learning. </p>

<p>
I am interested in metacognition and ultimately helping people achieve their goals &amp; become their best selves. 
</p>

<p>This site (perhaps obviously) is still a work-in-progress, so check back later. I have quite a number of todos, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Actually edit + port education posts over</li>
	<li>Making "page" layout .md-compatible?</li>
	<li>Adding a search bar</li>
	<li>Make page for puzzles and projects, remove "posts" </li>
</ul>
