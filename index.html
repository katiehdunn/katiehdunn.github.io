<p>Hello!</p>

<p>This site (perhaps obviously) is still a work-in-progress, so check back later (in a couple months?). I have quite a number of todos, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Port my posts over</li>
	<li>Link external docs on cv</li>
	<li>Change alpha order of menu</li>
	<li>How to make "page" layout .md-compatible?</li>
	<li>Make page for creative//fix "Categories" </li>
</ul>

<p> <i>A bit about me:</i>
These days, I'm a MA-certified STEM teacher and M.Ed. candidate. I graduated from MIT with a B.S. in Physics in 2018, and am currently enrolled in a M.Ed. program at Woodrow Wilson Graduate School in Cambridge. I taught in Boston Public Schools for two years as a student teacher, completed the Scheller Teacher Education Program at MIT, and worked in informal learning spaces &amp; educational summer programs since 2014.
</p>

<p>
I am interested in metacognition and helping learners to both achieve their goals &amp; become their best selves. I began my higher education believing I would go into academia, but officially transitioned from the physical sciences to secondary education in my undergraduate senior year. A generalist at heart, I have studied linguistics, earth sciences, astronomy, literature, biology, and behavioral sciences; that said, my enduring passion has been &amp; continues to be learning about learning.
