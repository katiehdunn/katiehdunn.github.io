A bit about me: 
These days, I'm a MA-certified STEM teacher and M.Ed. candidate. I graduated from MIT with a B.S. in Physics in 2018, and am currently enrolled in a M.Ed. program at Woodrow Wilson Graduate School in Cambridge. I taught in Boston Public Schools for two years as a student teacher, completed the Scheller Teacher Education Program at MIT, and worked in informal learning spaces &amp; educational summer programs since 2014.

I am interested in metacognition and helping learners to both achieve their goals &amp; become their best selves. I began my higher education believing I would go into academia, but officially transitioned from the physical sciences to secondary education in my undergraduate senior year. A generalist at heart, I have studied linguistics, earth sciences, astronomy, literature, biology, and behavioral sciences; that said, my enduring passion has been &amp; continues to be learning about learning.
