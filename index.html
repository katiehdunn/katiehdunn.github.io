<p>Hello! I'm Katie, a part-time education researcher.</p>

<p>I'm currently exploring options beyond the field of education, looking to contribute to things that both <i>feel like</i> they do good and <i>actually</i>do good. (While those goals may sound similar, I think they end up being surprisingly distinct in practice.)</p>

<p>You can find out more about what I'm up to personally and professionally.</p> 

<p>This site (perhaps obviously) is very much a work-in-progress, so please check back later!</p>
