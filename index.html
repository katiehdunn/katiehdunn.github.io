<p>Hello! I'm Katie, a part-time education researcher.</p>

<p>I'm currently exploring options beyond the field of education, looking to contribute to things that both <i>feel like</i> they do good and <i>actually</i> do good. (While those goals may sound similar, I think they end up being surprisingly distinct in practice.)</p>

<p>I've tried to keep this site mostly up to date with my <a href="/personal">personal</a> and <a href="/cv">professional</a> ventures. To get in touch, you can also send a message to my gmail account, <code>katiehdunn</code>.</p> 

<p>This site (perhaps obviously) is very much a work-in-progress, so please check back later!</p>
