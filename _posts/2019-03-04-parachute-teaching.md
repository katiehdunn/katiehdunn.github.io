This past week, I parachute-taught 7th graders at Chelsea Public Schools. Unlike traditional substitute teaching, parachute teachers are given the freedom to teach anything they like (ideally, something within their expertise, or that they’re passionate about). For instance, a chef might come in and talk abut various cooking techniques or cuisines, while a programmer could show off some 3D-printed artifacts and guide students in making their own things.

In theory, it’s a great idea. I remember all the times I had a substitute and did some worksheet that was obviously just busywork thrown together at the last minute. As a high schooler, I also would’ve benefitted from exposure to subjects outside the school curriculum; high-school me thought the space of “academically legitimate” possibilities was limited to what was offered in school, and would never have considered actually pursuing a field like astronomy or linguistics without outside inspiration.

In practice, though, the parachute teacher program requires nothing of the parachuter beyond a background check. I was given a packet with some logistics: how to get there, how to log in, the bell schedule – and then we were off!

As someone who has already taught full-time in Boston, worked with students from diverse backgrounds, and explored a wide variety of learning spaces in general, I thought I would be fairly well-prepared.

Needless to say, I was not.

When I recount the experience to others, they all point fingers at the district. “Chelsea… it’s something else,” they say to me. I’m not really sure that’s true. It seems unlikely that I would just happen to be placed in some outlier district, and that there aren’t tons of other places like this. (Surprising side note: S1 did not even register that the student population was 95% minority students! Apparently, my brain just bins ‘white’ and ‘hispanic’ together, and doesn’t even think twice about it.) I am still chalking it up to “high-energy 7th graders”.

Without further ado, my experience:

As I entered the colorful math classroom, a student comes up to me and asks if I’m new here. I say yes, and he says, “Good luck – it’s going to be hard teaching here.” Hm. Well, I had a slide deck prepared for facilitating a discussion introducing linguistics; I had already simplified it significantly from my normal approach, and had explicitly prepared for a fairly interactive, high-level lesson that wouldn’t consist of me just be blathering on for 45 minutes straight.

Turns out,  I wouldn’t even get the chance to start.

First period began… except it didn’t. Students didn’t ever settle down or sit in their seats, electing instead to continue talking (and quite loudly at that). I tried to get their attention with some textbook “attention grabbing signals” (e.g. two fingers in the air, simply waiting it out), but nothing happened. I asked individuals to please speak a little more quietly, so that I could at least explain what was happening without having to literally yell over them. No such luck. I forged on with my presentation, and perhaps that was a mistake – it became a constant battle of “who could be louder” between the middle schoolers laughing with their friends and me trying to explain who I was, why I was there, and what language was. When I asked for any interaction, I was met with blank stares from the quieter half of the audience.

Halfway through, I gave up. Okay, you win. Go get your Chromebooks. From then, they got quieter as everyone immersed themselves in a flash game. I tried circulating through the room and talking with individual cliques (while making sure no fights escalated past throwing pencils). I tried asking, is there anything you want to learn? – like, about anything? languages, biology, space? But everyone responded in the negative: nah, not really.

Next class, I tried to reason with them: let’s make a deal. I’ll try to convince you language is exciting in the first half, and then I’ll let you choose whether to keep listening or to go get a Chromebook . But I’m not convinced saying that made any difference: though some quarter of the class preferred computers and bought in, the people who were very loud didn’t care and kept talking anyway. I forged on for a bit but ultimately gave up even sooner this time.

Come third period, I wondered whether I was just giving up too early, giving in because it was easier. I also tried streamlining startup by telling people ahead of time we would be learning about languages, and trying to get people’s names at the door. As class started, I just determinedly talked at them, competing for volume all the while. This time, a group of 4 students gathered close to me to hear better. But when I tried using proximity on groups that weren’t paying attention, all I got was losing everyone else, so attempting to get the whole class at once probably wasn’t worth it. Halfway through the class (which felt like an eternity), I allowed students to get Chromebooks out again, and lost my small audience. At that, I wondered if I hadn’t given up too soon yet again. The final classes went similarly.

So, how did it go?

Well, none of my students actively hated me. In fact, many actually liked me (“are you coming back?” & “don’t go!” & saying hi to me on the sidewalks afterschool), but of course, that’s just because I let them play computer games. That said, when I didn’t allow computers, they weren’t really learning anything either [citation needed]. But ultimately, student feedback is not a great proxy for learning/I don’t think it’s correct to optimize for fun. But I believed so strongly in not making any student’s day worse that I ended up caring too much about how students felt at every given moment. If I had more time with them, this kind of behavior would build trust and good relationships, but it definitely doesn’t work for a one-off.

I had come in with the goal of getting a small fraction of people excited about linguistics. I probably achieved this with at most 3 people per class. I also had a goal of “not making anyone’s day worse” – this means not getting mad at or otherwise punishing individuals. I think people had a good time in that class. So in some senses, it was okay. But it still felt pretty existentially eyebrowraising to live through. If my career teaching felt like this more than a third of the time, I would probably do something else with my life. (Sidenote: I believe with fairly high confidence it won’t; my experiences in high school are uniformly more pleasant, regardless of the learners’ level.)

Another thought: what looks good isn’t always what is good. The whole time, a paraeducator was coming in with “motivational comments”, reminding me my job was just to keep the volume down, make sure nobody stabbed anyone else, and not to keep wasting energy & setting myself up for disappointment by trying to teach. Compare the following two scenarios: (A) you walk into a classroom and see a teacher lecturing, but the students are yelling over her and running around. Here, it looks like the teacher is trying, but the students are just “too unruly”. Perhaps the teacher should learn about classroom management. (B) you walk into a very noisy classroom. Students are all over the room, talking amongst themselves or playing computer games, while the teacher is conversing on the side with 2-3 students. Here, it looks like the teacher isn’t doing her job.

Throughout the day, I experienced a constant fear of administration coming in and getting mad at me – even though I stand by my actions. The “classroom management” route is inherently inequitable, relying on striking fear into the hearts of students via threats of punishments, forcing theme to appear attentive, and generally turning curious and lively humans into automatons. What does this teach them long-term? That this subject sucked so much that they had to be forced to care? That teachers have power they don’t?

Instead of feeling disheartened about the whole endeavor, I left eager to reflect and go try again. My graduate school has a motto, “try learn try” – it is a call to the iterative nature of design thinking, and learning by doing – something I finally feel like I got to live through this parachute-teaching disaster. I surprised myself with how resilient I felt to (in??) the setbacks, and was ready to tackle the problem it different ways over the course of the day. By the end of the day, I was teaching more linguistics, not less. I guess one way to think about WW’s principles is, it’s the derivative that counts.


A pretty cute video (despite the somewhat clickbait-y title) that showcases some principles of Just Doing It
During studio debrief time, my peers and I ideated some concrete experiments to try next time to avoid the fiasco. Next time:

I will make my expectations for the day more explicit, writing the plan + a clear directive (e.g. sit in your seats) on the board. This means I won’t have to rely on getting everyone’s attention verbally.
I will bring in some novel attention-grabber that isn’t just my voice, e.g. a bell. Hopefully this lets me talk to the class for a minute, but if this fails, I’ll just go to individual groups and let them know what’s going on.
I will ask students to get into groups of 1 to 6. By default, students will be “doing work on computers” (i.e. enjoying themselves), but for 5-10 minutes they’ll be learning something in a small pod with me. What they learn will be chosen from a list of at least 2 options I create ahead of time. This allows me to cater to individuals, and I am much happier about how I manage the small-group dynamic with people I don’t know.
I’ll make [some of] my lessons more clickbait-y. I know, not great, but the attention span of generic middle schoolers is probably a lot lower than I think – I recently heard the number 5 seconds. (Evidence that this is a good update: Students were willing to answer quick questions like “what color is this” or give a quick yes/no. Students groaned at having to listen for “a whole 20 minutes”. Students stopped paying attention when I wasn’t near them.)
I’ll take attendance at the end of class, so there isn’t an awkward period for students of shuffling around and not knowing what’s happening.
I also feel prepared to talk to admin about what’s happening in the classroom. My planned experiments look a lot more like the above-described scenario B to someone walking in. I believe more learning is happening in B than A, even though it’s not traditional and may look like a mess. After all, I was told most full-time teachers just let students talk all class; in this case, I think something is better than nothing, and it’s certainly worth trying.
