I’m not sure the titular term is the correct one. But I want to point at something(s) that apply(s) when you know material really well, and therefore on some level assume someone else also knows it. It might be the illusion of transparency + failing at PCK-seeking/theory of mind. It’s definitely similar to the idea of “pentagons” or:

I feel this in action many times.

As a teacher, going through the same spiel 6 times a day, I’m bound to forget to add a subtlety in one of the periods. Usually 2nd period is best since I’ve ironed out kinks from the first class without  skimming over everything by later classes.
Writing trivia is very hard. The answers feel “obvious” to me, but are not at all. Writing puzzles feels much the same way – you’re writing to lose.
When I write pieces for a learning blog project, by the nth edit I am skimming and somewhat loathe to explain myself with more words. A similar feeling holds when I’m having to write down thoughts that were made clear to me in last night’s conversation via blog post, or if I’m trying to clarify myself in an n page essay for english. My mind needs at least 2 or 3 days break before I can read it “with fresh eyes”. (In general, writing needs time to sit before it’s ripe for editing; it’s a good sign when I look over an old piece and it makes me cringe.)
Anki used to be useable, but now I quickly fall asleep shortly after I open it. The white screen, black unchanging text… it kills my attention instantly.
I’ve been at SSP in ’13, ’17, and ’18. While ’17 felt fresh and engaged my attention, this year it already felt too familiar, so I started doing things on autopilot. I felt less authentic in my actions and interactions.
I wonder if there are two distinct things I’m pointing at here. One is that knowledge feels obvious in my head to me but needs to be methodically conveyed to others. Another is that fresh eyes are hard to come by, and it’s easy to start caching actions/acting on autopilot when an environment is familiar. I’m not sure how to overcome these feelings besides surface-level alterations (e.g. changing the font on an essay I’m editing).
